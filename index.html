                        My name is Patrick, but many also know me as Kojo. I’m from Ghana, currently living in the beautiful city of Cape Coast.
                        I’m a BYU Pathway student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Development.
                        I have a passion for creating cherished memories and exploring different aspects of life. I’m always eager to learn new
                        things and embrace fresh experiences.
